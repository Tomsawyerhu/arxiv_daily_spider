## 摘要
> The growing availability of mobility data has provided new insights into consumer travel patterns. This paper studies how such data, and the mobility patterns it reveals, affect the pricing and location decisions of two competing firms, the value of the data to an intermediary, and the resulting welfare implications. We consider a setting in which consumers commute from suburban homes to downtown workplaces. Firms choose whether to locate in the suburbs or downtown. We show that firms choose downtown locations only when the volume of commuting is moderate. If commuting is low, there are too few customers downtown; if commuting is high, intensified competition makes suburban locations more attractive. When both firms locate in the suburbs without data, the intermediary optimally sells to a single firm, whereas they potentially sell data to both firms when there is a firm downtown in the no data case. Mobility data can reduce overall welfare in cities with large but low-activity downtowns, or in compact downtowns with high levels of retail activity.

## 摘要
> Crypto assets are subject to financial and bespoke regulations in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). Regulatory effectiveness requires assets to be subject to the regulatory regime that addresses their risks best, whilst regulatory fairness requires market participants to be able to identify the regulatory standards they need to comply with. Whilst comparing the interplay between financial and bespoke crypto-asset regulations in the US and the EU, this article finds that the two polities might be embarking on different paths of crypto-asset regulation. The former moves in the direction of tech-sensitivity, whereas the latter sticks with strict tech-neutrality. This could be an early indicator of future divergent approaches to the currently unregulated crypto markets, such as decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens. As a result and considering the inherently global nature of crypto as an asset class, international cooperation and policy learning are likely to be of paramount importance for effective future crypto regulation.

## 摘要
> Where is the place of humanity in current corporate and insolvency frameworks and their theoretical underpinning? How can it be assured that the institutions that have been invented through human ingenuity and brilliance serves the collective human experience fully and equitably? Insolvency law has long been theoretically conceptualised on the basis of legal and contractual entitlements with the core purpose of maximising returns to the creditors owed by the debtor during its financial distress. With the onset and steady growth of the rescue culture with its acknowledgment of the broader impacts of insolvency on society and the economy, the simple creditor wealth maximisation approach does not provide equitable solutions for all of the stakeholder associated with the debtor company. In particular, involuntary, non-adjusting, and undiversified creditors, such as employees, tort creditors, and the environment, are often with little recourse and few opportunities for participation at the negotiation table. These stakeholders suffer from greater exposure and fragility in their corporate relationships with little power or choice on that relationship and its impact on them. If theories are devised with humans in mind, it may be possible to redress the inequity in fairness by changing the way we view financial distress and the broader purpose for resolving it. This article seeks to reframe the way fairness is assessed and applied to achieve equitable solutions in the corporate and insolvency sphere by examining it through a feminist jurisprudential lens, with a particular focus on Martha Fineman's Vulnerability Theory.

## 摘要
> This essay responds to a recent article calling for human rights to be treated as a foundational principle in government procurement, with a focus on AI systems. While supporting the spirit of the proposal, the essay cautions that the suggested framework risks overburdening already strained contracting officers and could further erode the federal supplier base by deterring small and emerging firms. The essay argues that durable reform depends not on additional mandates, but on sustained engagement with procurement professionals and a practical understanding of the procurement system’s operational constraints.

## 关键词
**Media attention | carbon disclosures | Patient capital | corporate ESG greenwashing**

## 摘要
> Corporate ESG greenwashing, characterized by deceptive sustainability claims that distort information disclosure and exacerbate resource misallocation, poses significant challenges to responsible investment. This study examines how media scrutiny is an effective external monitoring mechanism to mitigate such practices among China's A-share listed companies (2009-2023). Our findings demonstrate that both headline-level and content-based media attention significantly deter ESG greenwashing through dual pathways: enhancing the transparency of carbon disclosures and fostering long-term oriented "patient capital". The constraining effect proves particularly pronounced when media adopts neutral or negative tones, with public attention amplifying this disciplinary function through synergistic interactions. Regional and sectoral heterogeneity reveals stronger effects in eastern China and firms with poor CSR disclosure quality. At the same time, headline scrutiny dominates in non-high-tech sectors versus content analysis' superior efficacy in high-tech industries. These insights advance ESG governance theory by elucidating media's multidimensional monitoring role while offering regulators actionable frameworks for developing integrated surveillance systems that combine surface-level screening with substantive content evaluation.

## 摘要
> Challenges in the modern manufacturing industry require optimization of precise and efficient production processes, especially in the manufacture of mechanical components such as End Blocks that play an important role in the dies system. This study aims to analyze the implementation of the End Block component manufacturing process with a Mazatrol Smart CNC technology-based approach through experimental studies and strengthening theoretical foundations. The main contribution of this study lies in the integration of CAD design methods, CAM validation, and CNC machine operation as a form of implementing industry 4.0 technology in a vocational education practicum environment. The methodology used includes a review of the latest literature, 3D CAD model design, tool path verification with CAM software, and the actual machining process using a CNC machine and a conventional lathe. The process is carried out with cutting parameters including 800 rpm spindle rotation, 0.2 mm/rev feed rate, and 1 mm cutting depth. The final results show that the component has a dimensional tolerance within the design limits (diameter 39.98 mm and length 40.02 mm), and a surface roughness of Ra 3.1 µm, which indicates good quality results. These findings show that an integrative approach based on CAD/CAM and CNC is able to increase efficiency, accuracy, and reduce the potential for product defects. This practicum is a strategic medium in applying theory to real practice in the field of manufacturing engineering.

## 关键词

## 摘要
> Problem definition: We consider a joint problem of pricing, replenishment, and salvaging across multiple stores connected to multiple warehouses. Given an initial allocation of units across warehouses and stores, the firm must determine replenishment quantities from warehouses to stores and replenishment quantities between warehouses. Additionally, the firm dynamically determines the prices charged at each store and the number of units to be sold through secondary channels at each store. Formulated as a discrete-time, non-stationary Markov Decision Process, the problem faces significant computational challenges due to the curse of dimensionality and non-linear replenishment costs. Methodology/results: We show that this problem can be equivalently represented as an assignment problem, where stores are assigned to specific inventory and price combinations. Through this framework, we can express the problem using linear cost functions without any loss of optimality. This framework is finalized through a discrete mean-field approximation, which extends the standard mean-field formulation by providing discrete, feasible decisions with limited computational cost. We prove that the discrete mean-field policy provides a sub-linear optimality gap in the number of stores and warehouses. Moreover, we also prove that the mean-field model provides a lower bound to the optimal cost, which numerical experiments indicate is attained for larger networks. Managerial implications: The generality of our assignment-based mean-field reformulation allows for its application to broader joint inventory and pricing problems with non-linear costs. Through numerical experiments, we show that the discrete mean-field model performs near-optimally across various scenarios with different network structures and settings, where all stores have distinct features. We also illustrate the value of integrating the rounding step into the core decision-making, in contrast to making continuous decisions and rounding for implementation. Lastly, we extend our work to cases including inventory placement, lead times, and heterogeneous stores.

**Big Five personality traits | Commuting satisfaction | Travel behavior | Social network data**

## 摘要
> Commuting is a daily activity that significantly affects individuals’ well-being, especially when prolonged travel time and discomfort are involved. Increased commuting duration and distance can lead to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, deteriorated mental health, and reduced work productivity. Although numerous studies have investigated commuting satisfaction through surveys, such methods face limitations in data scale and reliability. This study introduces a novel approach using social media data to analyze psychological and environmental factors affecting commuting satisfaction. Text data were collected from subreddit posts and comments via web scraping. BERTopic and sentiment analysis were applied to extract key themes and emotional responses, which were then used as latent variables in structural equation modeling (SEM) and importance analysis. Among the Big Five personality traits, openness and agreeableness positively influenced commuting satisfaction, while neuroticism showed a negative impact. Emotion scores and subjectivity were identified as important psychological factors. Regarding environmental variables, positive effects were observed for public transportation payment systems, while pandemic-related regulations and winter weather had negative effects. Moreover, the impact of these factors varied by personality type, suggesting that individual differences must be considered in policy planning. Based on these insights, the study proposes targeted policy recommendations, such as improving public transit payment infrastructure, reducing emotional stress, and mitigating seasonal barriers. This research provides a scalable and data-driven framework for understanding commuting experiences and highlights the potential of personality-informed transportation policies aimed at enhancing commuters’ quality of life.

## 摘要
> Financial crimes pose significant challenges to legal and economic systems worldwide, with varying definitions, enforcement mechanisms, and jurisdictional disparities complicating their prosecution. This paper examines the mediation of financial crimes through a restorative justice lens, with a specific focus on Pakistan. The study begins by defining financial crimes, distinguishing them from related concepts such as financial abuse, and exploring their diverse categories-including fraud, money laundering, and corruption. It highlights jurisdictional ambiguities in legal frameworks and enforcement, particularly concerning predicate offenses and global compliance. The paper then evaluates the application of mediation in financial crime cases, assessing its suitability, global trends, and procedural complexities. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of mediation, emphasizing restorative justice principles while addressing challenges such as parallel criminal proceedings and jurisdictional variations. Finally, the study investigates Pakistan's legal and regulatory framework for financial crimes, analyzing the efficacy of mediation mechanisms and plea bargaining. It critiques existing enforcement gaps, ethical concerns, and ongoing reforms, offering recommendations to strengthen financial crime mediation in Pakistan. By integrating comparative legal analysis with case-specific insights, this research contributes to the discourse on alternative dispute resolution in financial crime enforcement, particularly in developing jurisdictions.
