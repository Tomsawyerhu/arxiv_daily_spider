We show that firms choose downtown locations only when the volume of commuting is moderate. If commuting is low, there are too few customers downtown; if commuting is high, intensified competition makes suburban locations more attractive. When both firms locate in the suburbs without data, the intermediary optimally sells to a single firm, whereas they potentially sell data to both firms when there is a firm downtown in the no data case. Mobility data can reduce overall welfare in cities with large but low-activity downtowns, or in compact downtowns with high levels of retail activity.", "keywords": "mobility data, location and price competition, equilibrium analysis", "summary": "文章研究了出行数据如何影响两竞争企业的定价与选址决策、数据对中介的价值及社会福利影响。技术上分析消费者通勤模式对企业区位选择的作用，并探讨中介在不同场景下出售数据的策略。"}

Our findings demonstrate that both headline-level and content-based media attention significantly deter ESG greenwashing through dual pathways: enhancing the transparency of carbon disclosures and fostering long-term oriented \"patient capital\". The constraining effect proves particularly pronounced when media adopts neutral or negative tones, with public attention amplifying this disciplinary function through synergistic interactions. Regional and sectoral heterogeneity reveals stronger effects in eastern China and firms with poor CSR disclosure quality. At the same time, headline scrutiny dominates in non-high-tech sectors versus content analysis' superior efficacy in high-tech industries.

Given an initial allocation of units across warehouses and stores, the firm must determine replenishment quantities from warehouses to stores and replenishment quantities between warehouses. Additionally, the firm dynamically determines the prices charged at each store and the number of units to be sold through secondary channels at each store. Formulated as a discrete-time, non-stationary Markov Decision Process, the problem faces significant computational challenges due to the curse of dimensionality and non-linear replenishment costs. Methodology/results: We show that this problem can be equivalently represented as an assignment problem, where stores are assigned to specific inventory and price combinations. Through this framework, we can express the problem using linear cost functions without any loss of optimality. This framework is finalized through a discrete mean-field approximation, which extends the standard mean-field formulation by providing discrete, feasible decisions with limited computational cost. We prove that the discrete mean-field policy provides a sub-linear optimality gap in the number of stores and warehouses. Moreover, we also prove that the mean-field model provides a lower bound to the optimal cost, which numerical experiments indicate is attained for larger networks. Managerial implications: The generality of our assignment-based mean-field reformulation allows for its application to broader joint inventory and pricing problems with non-linear costs. Through numerical experiments, we show that the discrete mean-field model performs near-optimally across various scenarios with different network structures and settings, where all stores have distinct features. We also illustrate the value of integrating the rounding step into the core decision-making, in contrast to making continuous decisions and rounding for implementation. Lastly, we extend our work to cases including inventory placement, lead times, and heterogeneous stores.", "keywords": "Supply chain management, Inventory theory and control, Pricing and revenue management, Stochastic methods", "summary": "文章解决多门店与多仓库间的动态定价、补货与残值处理联合决策问题，采用离散均场近似技术将复杂问题转化为线性成本的分配问题，实现次优解并有效应对计算挑战。"}

Among the Big Five personality traits, openness and agreeableness positively influenced commuting satisfaction, while neuroticism showed a negative impact. Emotion scores and subjectivity were identified as important psychological factors. Regarding environmental variables, positive effects were observed for public transportation payment systems, while pandemic-related regulations and winter weather had negative effects. Moreover, the impact of these factors varied by personality type, suggesting that individual differences must be considered in policy planning. Based on these insights, the study proposes targeted policy recommendations, such as improving public transit payment infrastructure, reducing emotional stress, and mitigating seasonal barriers.
